Now that we have learned how to render react components, let's have you render a component in a test all by yourself.

Looking at App.js now, you can see that we're rendering these two circles, and now looking at the browser, we can
see that it renders the circles based on the diameter provided.

What you need to do in this exercise, is create a circle.test.js file where you test that the circle will render with
no provided props.

You'll find the link to this codesandbox in the video's notes.

While writing your tests, you can validate that they are working by going to the Tests tab.
Currently, we only have an app.test.js file, but soon you'll have a circle.test.js file as well

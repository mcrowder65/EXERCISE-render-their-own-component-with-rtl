Now that we have learned how to render react components, let's have you render a component in a test all by yourself.

Looking at App.js now, you can see that we're rendering these two circles, and now looking at the browser, we can

What you need to do in this exercise, is create a circle.test.js file where you test that the circle will render with
no provided props.
